# Security-Camera

Description:
Welcome to the OpenCV Human Detection Security Camera project! This repository hosts a Python-based security camera system that utilizes the power of OpenCV for real-time human detection and video recording. This project is designed to enhance your security monitoring capabilities by automatically capturing video footage when human presence is detected in the camera's field of view.

Features:

Human Detection: Our project leverages OpenCV's computer vision capabilities to detect human presence in the camera feed accurately. This ensures that you are alerted whenever someone enters the monitored area.

Real-time Monitoring: The system provides real-time monitoring of the camera feed, allowing you to watch the video stream and receive alerts as soon as a human is detected.

Video Recording: When a human presence is detected, the system automatically initiates video recording. These recordings are timestamped, providing a valuable record of security events.

Configurable Parameters: Easily adjust various parameters such as detection sensitivity, camera input source, recording duration, and more to customize the system to your specific needs.

Installation and Usage:
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
Run the Python script to start the security camera system.
Monitor the system's output for real-time alerts and recorded videos in the specified directory.
